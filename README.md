# nonprofit-crypto-donations-tool
To encourage people who make $$$ off crypto to donate, we're creating DonateDAO. DonateDAO is the Giving Pledge for Web3 (https://givingpledge.org/). We provide a smart contract solution that allows users to pledge a certain amount of $ to a non-profit when your portfolio reaches a certain limit (ex: automatically donating $1m if their portfolio reaches $10M). Members who pledge are invited to join a DAO with fellow pledge members so that they can collaborate on their charity efforts (ex: decide on common charities to donate to)
